Course materials for the Machine Learning Club at TNA

These tutorials are designed to run in a Google Colab environment with scripts and data hosted in GDrive. Some amendments to file paths would be needed to run in a different environment.
For GDrive, a folder called MLC should be created under 'My Drive' and then the session folders uploaded into that folder. There are obvious path variables at the beginnings of the tutorials if a different setup is used or desired.

Start at Session 0 to test that connection to GDrive works and data files are in the correct folder.

Tutorials are sometimes incremental so should be completed in the following order:

Session 1 - Data analysis and cleansing
- Zoo analysis
- Census analysis
- Amazon reviews analysis
